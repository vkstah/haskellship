  -- TODO: Game implementation
  --    1. Initialize empty board (10x10) for each player
  --    2. Place ships on the board using coordinates (x,y)
  --    3. Take turns at firing to a set of coordinates on the board
  --    4. Once all of the ships are destroyed from either player, end the game
  --    5. Declare one player as a winner
